Allow your users (except for administrators) to manually delete their own accounts.

== Description ==
Allow your users (except for administrators) to manually delete their own accounts. It uses the <a href="http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/">Sweet Alert</a> jQuery plugin for slick-looking alerts and prompts.

By default, this plugin adds a button to a user's profile page in the wp-admin. You can also add a delete button to any page or post using the `[wp_delete_user_accounts]` shortcode.

NOTE: Delete buttons are not displayed when logged in as an administrator. This is done to protect against locking yourself out of your site. To see the delete button, youâ€™ll need to log in with an account that does not have the administrator role.

For more technical info, including available hooks (actions and filters), please see the plugin's [readme file on Github](https://github.com/renventura/wp-delete-user-accounts).
